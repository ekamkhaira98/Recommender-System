# Recommender-System
The project has been divided into various tasks.
The following are the major tasks:
1. Dataset containing articles/documents containing variety of topics to help in making recommendations effective as it will consider cross topic documents in the corpus
2. Preprocessing, understanding and analyzing of dataset. It involves cleaning of dataset in order to remove noise contribution in decision making of recommendation. Eg stop words removal, special character removal etc.
3. Understanding documents by creating their embeddings in multidimensional space by using model like word2vec or any other based on their performance with the words in document dataset
4. Finding relationship to other documents using Machine learning algorithms like KNN, clustering etc. Understanding how similarity between documents work with different Data Science algorithms
5. Finding recommendations based on closest similar documents in terms of its closeness in the multidimensional space.
